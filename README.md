# Capstone-Project-Nik
This is my capstone project

🔧 Infrastructure Automation:
Provisioned scalable EC2 instances on AWS using Terraform and Ansible for repeatable deployments.

⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline:
Implemented end-to-end pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub Actions for seamless build, test, and deployment — ensuring zero-downtime releases.

🔐 Security & Compliance:
Integrated Spring Security, enforced auth mechanisms, and performed vulnerability scanning using SonarQube, Trivy, and OWASP Dependency Check.

📊 Monitoring & Logging:
Set up real-time dashboards using Prometheus and Grafana, and integrated CloudWatch for log tracking and performance tuning.

It was a great hands-on journey building this end-to-end DevOps pipeline! 💻🚀
